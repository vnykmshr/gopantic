## Security Considerations

When using gopantic, be aware of:

1. **Error Message Content**: Error messages include field names and values. Avoid logging errors containing sensitive data in production.

2. **Input Size Limits**: Configure `MaxInputSize` when parsing untrusted data to prevent resource exhaustion.

3. **Reflection Usage**: The library uses reflection for type coercion. Ensure your struct definitions don't expose unintended fields.

4. **Dependency Security**: We maintain minimal dependencies (only yaml.v3 in production). Run `go mod verify` regularly and keep dependencies updated.
